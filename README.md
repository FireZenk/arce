# ARCE: Android remote command executor

The idea behind this project is to provide a way to interact with Android apps remotely from a web browser.
By extending the commads supported in `arce-server` and its interpreter at `arce-app` the posibilities on android interactions are limitless.

**arce-app**: Sample implementation of ARCE in Android

**arce-client**: Websocket client library for Android

**arce-server**: Ktor based websocket server
